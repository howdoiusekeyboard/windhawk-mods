## 1.4 ([Oct 5, 2025](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/3e8b6dcf0692df8cdba401d7d6ef4ee54ce5bdbe/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal.wh.cpp))

* Add support for Spotify 1.2.72 to 1.2.74
* Add an option to block the Spotify client from updating itself
* Prevent Basic frames from being wrongly drawn when entering and exiting the full-screen mode

## 1.3 ([Aug 24, 2025](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/bdd9ada4189479dd475c3db41ee033f5ef190a17/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal.wh.cpp))

* Add support for Spotify 1.2.66-1.2.71
* Changing the playback speed is no longer supported on Spotify 1.2.67 and higher due to Spotify blocking the way this mod changed it
* Fix basic frames being drawn wrongly when entering and exiting the full-screen mode, when the native frames are disabled

## 1.2 ([Jun 5, 2025](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/4341502030118d63157c4bc43d74f199aa667e19/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal.wh.cpp))

* Fixed compatibility with the Translucent Windows mod
    * At least version 1.5 of the Translucent Windows mod is required. 1.4 and below are still not supported when the native frames are disabled

## 1.1 ([Jun 3, 2025](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/5a9dafdec518bcd45686bc0e87f61858f7ce5d01/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal.wh.cpp))

* Finally implemented proper transparency support for frameless windows
    * In frameless mode, this mod is not compatible with the [Translucent Windows](https://windhawk.net/mods/translucent-windows) mod, due to the mod interfering with how this mod works around [Chromium's weird code](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:ui/views/win/hwnd_message_handler.cc;drc=339fea7fafdc1ba5b16e7b2fa6f9d996b65348a3;l=616)
    * Please use [MicaForEveryone](https://github.com/MicaForEveryone/MicaForEveryone) instead in frameless mode
    * This does not apply when the native frame option is enabled. Translucent Windows will work fine in this mode
* Prevent bad memory scan results with zero match persisting as a cached count value
* Prevent various time-consuming memory patch operations from running on known incompatible versions
* Added support for disabling the forced dark mode in Spotify versions between 1.2.21 and 1.2.25

## 1.0 ([May 29, 2025](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/363a9ab160fe2975c2fc1a7c359b488bbd43cc88/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal.wh.cpp))

* Added a standalone playback speed changer in the Windhawk mod settings page
  * Previously, this feature was only available via the JavaScript API
* Added support for Spotify 1.2.63 and 1.2.64, including the playback speed mod
* Added caching for memory patch offsets to improve the startup speed
* Added support for Windows 7 running older versions of the Spotify client (1.2.5 and below)
  * `--no-sandbox` is not required when running those older versions
  * Note that non-DWM mode might look broken due to Chromium's classic custom frames. It is recommended to enable Aero and then use a basic themer for using the Basic/Classic frames
  * You'll still need `--no-sandbox` when running newer versions with VxKex
* Fixed memory leaks in the renderer process caused by improperly managed V8 value memories
* Fixed the GPU acceleration status being detected wrongly and causing rendering issues when the hardware acceleration is enabled but unavailable
* Improved security by limiting the IPC pipe connection to the most recently spawned renderer

## 0.9 ([Apr 20, 2025](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/1d248fdd4964e037fc00cb9799cd5fb55fe92f77/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal.wh.cpp))

* Add support for Spotify 1.2.62
* Fix the `query()` API function not getting the latest option changes
* Now this mod uses a more proper way of changing the minimum window size
  * JavaScript `window.resizeTo()` should work fine for smaller sizes, and the resize cursor should always be shown when hovering over window borders
  * As a result, this feature no longer works on Spotify versions older than 1.1.71

## 0.8 ([Mar 26, 2025](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/e3cf3ac434db56bfb98c39e23f2215a8c4106600/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal.wh.cpp))

* Fixed Aero Glass not working and showing a white background instead in some cases

## 0.7 ([Feb 10, 2025](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/da2e72abc1f05e34d0737578eb8fcc8a17780a59/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal.wh.cpp))

* Add support for Spotify 1.2.57
* Fix JS API being unavailable on Spotify 1.2.4-1.2.32: use `window._getSpotifyModule('ctewh')` instead on these versions
* The transparent rendering, anti-forced dark mode, and Chrome extension enabler mods can now be applied even if the mod is loaded a bit late

## 0.6 ([Jan 30, 2025](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/1a126cbd6d9e3d268ccfe23eb3a5774acb456102/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal.wh.cpp))

* Add support for Spotify 1.2.55 and 1.2.56
* Support directly enabling transparent web content rendering without having to patch `Spotify.exe` manually
* Add options to disable forced dark mode or force-enable Chrome extension support
* Add a JavaScript API for interacting with this mod or the main window that can be used within Spicetify extensions and themes

## 0.5 ([Dec 25, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/d25beeb3c894c97d36c4fe7b52e67a3505ad78e2/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal.wh.cpp))

* Support making Spotify's custom window controls transparent
* Try to avoid crashes on untested newer releases of CEF/Spotify
* Support using DWM backgrounds with MicaForEveryone (requires hex patching `Spotify.exe`; see the mod details for instructions)

## 0.4 ([Dec 24, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/b8b4b7aaa97eae0a573b4cde7bcd95b869448bd9/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal.wh.cpp))

* The leftover space from hiding Spotify's custom window controls and the menu button is now clickable (mouse events are sent to the CEF browser)

## 0.3 ([Dec 21, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/e1dedbdcf972be80fa02d122d7379f9ca91e7582/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal.wh.cpp))

* Add support for Spotify 1.2.53
* The ignore minimum size option now works without having to enable the native frames option
* Add an option to enable native frames on non-main windows (miniplayer, DevTools, etc.)
* WM_NCPAINT fix now works on non-Spotify CEF applications

## 0.2 ([Dec 18, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/d9e7075dc68171e319427778e094cf9945dbe4a9/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal.wh.cpp))

* Now supports proper native window controls on all supported versions. DWM, Basic, and Classic are all supported.
* Fix show menu option not working properly when logging is disabled
* Fix Basic/Classic frames turning black in some cases (upstream Chromium issue)
* Add an option to ignore the minimum size set by Spotify

## 0.1 ([Dec 13, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/1c42a261bb552580949476c51ff569b15070ad6e/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal.wh.cpp))

Initial release.
